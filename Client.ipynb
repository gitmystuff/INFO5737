        "\n",
        "Key Changes and Explanations:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Input Sanitization:**\n",
        "    * The `sanitize_input()` function now removes a wider range of potentially dangerous characters, including single quotes, backslashes and semicolons, which can be used in command injection.\n",
        "    * `user_input = sanitize_input(data[\"message\"])` is added to the chat function to sanitize the user input.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **System Prompt Reinforcement:**\n",
        "    * The `system_input` has been modified to explicitly instruct the chatbot to avoid revealing sensitive information and running system commands. This is a form of prompt engineering to guide the model's behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Basic Output Validation:**\n",
        "    * Added a regular expression check on the `bot_response` to detect keywords that might indicate the chatbot is about to reveal sensitive information (API keys, passwords, etc.). If found, the response is replaced with a safe message.\n",
        "    * Added a regular expression check on the `user_input` to detect keywords that might indicate the user is trying to make the chatbot execute system commands. If found, the response is replaced with a safe message.\n",
        "\n",
        "Important Notes:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Defense in Depth:** Input sanitization and output validation should be used together for robust protection.\n",
        "* **Regular Expressions:** Regular expressions can be powerful tools for pattern matching, but they can also be complex. Test them thoroughly.\n",
        "* **Contextual Awareness:** For more sophisticated applications, you might need to maintain context and use more complex logic to detect and prevent prompt injection.\n",
        "* **Model limitations:** Even with these protections, LLMs can still be tricked. Continue to test and improve your defenses.\n",
        "* **No perfect solution:** Prompt injection is an ongoing research area. No solution is perfect.\n",

        "\n",
        "   * **What it is:**\n",
        "       * Attackers manipulate the data used to train the language model, causing it to exhibit biased, harmful, or incorrect behavior.\n",
        "       * This is harder to demonstrate in a live API setting but can be explained conceptually.\n",
        "   * **Demonstration:**\n",
        "       * **Explanation:** Show examples of how training data can be manipulated to insert biases or misinformation.\n",
        "       * **Code (Conceptual):** Discuss how training data is fed into the model and how it influences output. You won't be able to directly modify the model's training data via the API.\n",
        "   * **Mitigation:**\n",
        "       * Careful curation and validation of training data.\n",
        "       * Robust monitoring of model behavior for anomalies.\n",
        "\n",
        "Data poisoning is a significant concern, especially for models trained on vast, publicly available datasets. While we can't directly modify the Hugging Face API's training data, we can illustrate the concept and discuss mitigation strategies.\n",

        "**Understanding Data Poisoning:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **The Attack Vector:**\n",
        "    * Data poisoning occurs when malicious actors inject carefully crafted, harmful data into the training dataset of a machine learning model.\n",
        "    * This poisoned data can introduce biases, backdoors, or cause the model to generate incorrect or harmful outputs.\n",
        "* **Examples:**\n",
        "    * **Bias Injection:**\n",
        "        * Imagine a dataset used to train a sentiment analysis model. If an attacker injects a large number of positive reviews for a specific product, even if it's terrible, the model might start classifying all reviews for that product as positive.\n",
        "        * Another example would be if a data set used for facial recognition included a large amount of misslabeled photos, causing the model to misidentify people of a specific demographic.\n",
        "    * **Misinformation:**\n",
        "        * Poisoned training data can introduce false information into a language model's knowledge base. For example, injecting fabricated news articles can cause the model to generate and propagate misinformation.\n",
        "    * **Backdoors:**\n",
        "        * Attackers might inject specific trigger phrases into the training data. When these phrases are used in user input, the model might exhibit unintended behavior, such as revealing sensitive information or executing malicious code.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Conceptual Code Discussion:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Training Data Influence:**\n",
        "    * Language models learn patterns and relationships from the data they are trained on.\n",
        "    * If the training data contains biases or inaccuracies, the model will likely reflect those biases in its output.\n",
        "    * The model you are using has been trained on a massive amount of internet data, which is known to have these issues.\n",
        "* **API Limitations:**\n",
        "    * The Hugging Face Inference API provides access to pre-trained models. We cannot directly modify the training data used to create these models.\n",
        "    * Therefore, the mitigation must occur at the model creation stage.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Mitigation Strategies:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Data Curation and Validation:**\n",
        "    * Rigorous data cleaning and validation are essential to prevent data poisoning.\n",
        "    * This includes:\n",
        "        * Filtering out low-quality or irrelevant data.\n",
        "        * Detecting and removing duplicate or contradictory data.\n",
        "        * Verifying the accuracy and consistency of labels.\n",
        "    * Using multiple sources of data, and cross checking information.\n",
        "* **Anomaly Detection and Monitoring:**\n",
        "    * Continuously monitoring the model's behavior for anomalies can help detect signs of data poisoning.\n",
        "    * This includes:\n",
        "        * Tracking the model's performance on various benchmarks.\n",
        "        * Analyzing the model's output for unexpected patterns or biases.\n",
        "        * Implementing mechanisms to detect and flag suspicious user input.\n",
        "* **Federated Learning:**\n",
        "    * Federated learning, where models are trained on decentralized data sources, can help mitigate data poisoning risks by reducing reliance on a single, centralized dataset.\n",
        "* **Robustness Techniques:**\n",
        "    * Adversarial training can make models more robust to poisoned data by exposing them to adversarial examples during training.\n",
        "\n",
        "**In summary:** Data poisoning is a serious threat, but it is one that is hard to directly demonstrate using an API. The most important defense against it is careful data curation before the model is created, and careful monitoring of the model after it is deployed.\n"

        "\n",
        "* **Import `Limiter` and related functions:** We import the necessary components from `SlowAPI`.\n",
        "* **Initialize `Limiter`:** We create a `Limiter` instance, using `get_remote_address` to rate-limit based on the client's IP address.\n",
        "* **Add `Limiter` to app state and exception handler:** This sets up the rate limiting functionality.\n",
        "* **Apply rate limiting to `/chat/` endpoint:** We add `dependencies=[Depends(limiter.limit(\"5/minute\"))]` to the `/chat/` endpoint's decorator. This limits each client to 5 requests per minute.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Explanation:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* The `limiter.limit(\"5/minute\")` setting restricts each client to a maximum of 5 requests per minute.\n",
        "* If a client exceeds this limit, `SlowAPI` raises an `HTTPException`, which is handled by `_rate_limit_exceeded_handler`, returning a 429 \"Too Many Requests\" error.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Testing the Mitigation:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Run the DoS attack script again. You should now see that after 5 requests, the server starts returning 429 errors, preventing it from being overwhelmed.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Additional Mitigations:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** A WAF can provide more advanced DoS protection by filtering malicious traffic before it reaches your server.\n",
        "* **Load Balancing:** Distributing traffic across multiple servers can help mitigate the impact of DoS attacks.\n",
        "* **Cloud Providers:** Cloud providers often offer built-in DoS protection services.\n",

        "\n",
        "* **How it Works:**\n",
        "    * Serialization is the process of converting an object into a stream of bytes for storage or transmission.\n",
        "    * Deserialization is the reverse process, reconstructing the object from the byte stream.\n",

        "* **Attack Scenarios:**\n",
        "    * **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Attackers can inject malicious code into serialized objects, which is then executed when the object is deserialized.\n",
        "    * **Data Tampering:** Attackers can modify serialized objects to alter application behavior or access sensitive data.\n",
        "    * **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers can craft malicious serialized objects that consume excessive resources during deserialization, causing the application to crash.\n",

An attacker could intercept this serialized data, modify it to include malicious code, and then send it back to the server. When the server deserializes the modified object, the malicious code would be executed.\n",

        "    * These fingerprints (hashes) are used to verify data integrity.\n",
        "    * Secure hash functions like SHA-256 are essential for digital signatures.\n",
        "    * However, a hash alone doesn't provide authentication (proof of origin).\n",

        "1.  **Cryptographic Strength:**\n",
        "    * The underlying hash function and encryption algorithm must be cryptographically strong (resistant to collisions and attacks).\n",
        "    * Outdated or weak algorithms should be avoided.\n",
        "2.  **Key Management:**\n",

        "\n",
        "1.  **`hmac.new(SECRET_KEY, data.encode('utf-8'), hashlib.sha256)`:**\n",
        "    * `hmac.new()` is the function that creates a new HMAC object.\n",
        "    * `SECRET_KEY`: This is a secret cryptographic key that is known only to the sender and receiver. This key is *essential* for the security of the HMAC.\n",
        "    * `data.encode('utf-8')`: The `data` (the message you want to sign) is encoded into bytes using UTF-8 encoding. HMAC operates on bytes, not strings.\n",
        "    * `hashlib.sha256`: This specifies the cryptographic hash function to use (SHA-256 in this case). SHA-256 is a strong and widely used hash function.\n",
        "    * This part of the code initializes the HMAC object by combining the `SECRET_KEY` and the encoded `data` with the chosen hash function.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **.digest()**:\n",
        "    * The `.digest()` method computes the HMAC digest (the actual signature).\n",
        "    * The digest is a byte string that represents the HMAC signature of the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "**How the Secret is Combined:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* HMAC doesn't simply concatenate the secret key and the data. It uses a more complex and secure process involving:\n",
        "    * Padding the secret key.\n",
        "    * Performing XOR operations with the padded key and inner/outer pads.\n",
        "    * Applying the hash function multiple times.\n",
        "* This process ensures that the secret key is properly mixed with the data, preventing simple attacks like appending the key to the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why This Combination is Secure:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* The secret key is never directly appended to the data.\n",
        "* The HMAC algorithm is designed to be resistant to attacks that try to recover the secret key or forge signatures.\n",
        "* If an attacker doesn't have the secret key, they cannot generate a valid HMAC signature for the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "**In essence:** The `hmac.new()` function securely mixes the secret key with the data using the specified hash function to produce a unique signature that proves both the integrity and authenticity of the data.\n"

        "    * **Mitigation:**\n",
        "        * Use dependency scanning tools.\n",
        "        * Verify the integrity of downloaded packages.\n",

        "Supply chain attacks are a growing threat, and your chatbot application, like most modern software, relies on numerous third-party libraries. Let's explore how to protect your server-side code from this type of attack.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Understanding Supply Chain Attacks:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **How They Work:**\n",
        "    * Attackers compromise the software supply chain by injecting malicious code into third-party libraries or dependencies.\n",
        "    * This malicious code can then be executed within your application, granting attackers access to sensitive data or system resources.\n",
        "* **Attack Vectors:**\n",
        "    * **Compromised Package Repositories:** Attackers can compromise repositories like PyPI (Python Package Index) or npm (Node Package Manager) and upload malicious packages.\n",
        "    * **Dependency Confusion:** Attackers can upload packages with the same name as internal packages to public repositories, tricking applications into downloading the malicious versions.\n",
        "    * **Compromised Developer Accounts:** Attackers can compromise developer accounts and use them to publish malicious updates to legitimate libraries.\n",
        "    * **Malicious Code Injection:** attackers can inject malicious code into existing legitimate libraries.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Protecting Your Server-Side Code:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Dependency Scanning Tools:**\n",
        "    * Use tools like `pip-audit` (for Python) or `npm audit` (for Node.js) to scan your dependencies for known vulnerabilities.\n",
        "    * These tools can identify outdated or vulnerable libraries and provide recommendations for updates.\n",
        "    * **pip-audit Example:**\n",
        "        * Install `pip-audit`: `pip install pip-audit`\n",
        "        * Run `pip-audit`: `pip-audit`\n",
        "        * This will scan your project's dependencies and report any vulnerabilities.\n",
        "2.  **Verify Package Integrity:**\n",
        "    * Verify the integrity of downloaded packages using checksums or digital signatures.\n",
        "    * This can help prevent the installation of tampered packages.\n",
        "    * For example, when downloading packages manually, or from untrusted sources, compare the hash of the downloaded file with a known good hash.\n",
        "3.  **Keep Dependencies Up to Date:**\n",
        "    * Regularly update your dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.\n",
        "    * Use dependency management tools to automate this process.\n",
        "    * Be cautious with very new updates, as they may contain undiscovered issues.\n",
        "4.  **Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs):**\n",
        "    * Generate and maintain SBOMs to track the components of your application.\n",
        "    * SBOMs provide a comprehensive list of dependencies, making it easier to identify and address vulnerabilities.\n",
        "    * There are many tools that can generate SBOMs.\n",
        "5.  **Use Virtual Environments:**\n",
        "    * For python, always use virtual environments. This will isolate your project's dependencies, preventing conflicts and reducing the impact of compromised packages.\n",
        "6.  **Pin Dependencies:**\n",
        "    * Pin your dependencies to specific versions to prevent unexpected updates from introducing vulnerabilities.\n",
        "    * This ensures that you are using the same versions of libraries during development, testing, and production.\n",
        "7.  **Limit External Dependencies:**\n",
        "    * Reduce the number of external dependencies used by your application.\n",
        "    * This minimizes the attack surface and reduces the risk of supply chain attacks.\n",
        "8.  **Regular Security Audits:**\n",
        "    * Conduct regular security audits of your application and its dependencies.\n",
        "    * This can help identify and address potential vulnerabilities.\n",
        "\n",

        "**Explanation and Demonstration Points:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Secret Key:**\n",
        "    * The code highlights the importance of securely storing the `SECRET_KEY`.\n",
        "    * In a demonstration, you can emphasize the risks of hardcoding secrets and show how an attacker could exploit this.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **JWT Generation:**\n",
        "    * The `generate_jwt()` function creates a JWT with a payload containing the user ID, expiration time, and issue time.\n",
        "    * The `jwt.encode()` function signs the JWT using the `SECRET_KEY` and the HS256 algorithm.\n",
        "    * The print statements show the generated JWT.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **JWT Validation:**\n",
        "    * The `validate_jwt()` function decodes and verifies the JWT using the `SECRET_KEY`.\n",
        "    * It handles `jwt.ExpiredSignatureError` and `jwt.InvalidTokenError` exceptions.\n",
        "    * The print statements show the validation process and the extracted user ID.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Example Usage:**\n",
        "    * The code demonstrates how to generate a JWT for a user and then validate it.\n",
        "    * The output shows the extracted user ID if the token is valid.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  **Expired Token Simulation:**\n",
        "    * The code creates an expired JWT to demonstrate how the `validate_jwt()` function handles expired tokens.\n",
        "    * The output shows the \"JWT expired\" message.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.  **Invalid Token Simulation:**\n",
        "    * The code creates an invalid JWT to demonstrate how the `validate_jwt()` function handles invalid tokens.\n",
        "    * The output shows the \"Invalid JWT\" message.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Demonstration Ideas:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Show the JWT Structure:**\n",
        "    * Copy the generated JWT and paste it into a JWT decoder (e.g., jwt.io) to show its structure (header, payload, signature).\n",
        "    * Explain the purpose of each part of the JWT.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Modify the JWT:**\n",
        "    * Show how modifying the payload or signature of the JWT will cause the validation to fail.\n",
        "    * This demonstrates the integrity protection provided by JWTs.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Change the Secret Key:**\n",
        "    * Show how changing the `SECRET_KEY` will cause the validation to fail.\n",
        "    * This demonstrates the importance of keeping the secret key secure.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Explain HS256 Algorithm:**\n",
        "    * Explain the basics of the HS256 algorithm and how it uses a secret key to sign and verify JWTs.\n",
        "    * Emphasize that HS256 is a symmetric algorithm (same key for signing and verifying).\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Discuss Alternatives:**\n",
        "    * Briefly discuss other JWT algorithms (e.g., RS256) and their advantages and disadvantages.\n",
        "    * RS256 is an asymmetric algorithm, using a public/private key pair.\n"
